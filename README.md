# WeatherApp-Java

Welcome to my Weather App repository! 🌦️

As a beginner in Java programming, this Weather App represents my first hands-on experience in implementing an API using Java.

# What does the Weather App do?

The Weather App allows users to access real-time weather information for any location. Leveraging the power of Java and an API, it provides accurate and up-to-date weather data, giving users the ability to stay informed about the atmospheric conditions in their desired areas.

# Key Features: 
- API Integration: Learn how to connect and communicate with a weather API to fetch live weather data.
- Location-based weather: Users can input their desired location, and the app fetches the current weather conditions for that specific area.

# Learning Resources
This project was developed with guidance from the tutorials provided by @curadProgrammer. Check out their tutorials for a step-by-step understanding of Java programming and API integration.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and enhance this Weather App as you continue your Java programming journey. Happy coding! 🚀👨‍💻
